# 📄 Product Requirements Document – GPS Tracking Solution

## 🧩 Problem Statement

Organizations with mobile or distributed assets—such as vehicles, equipment, or personnel—often lack **real-time GPS telemetry** due to reliance on outdated, fragmented tracking systems. These gaps hinder operational efficiency, delay response times, and limit situational awareness.

There’s a growing need for a unified solution that leverages **low-power IoT devices** and **discreet GPS trackers with extended battery life** to provide continuous visibility without intrusive hardware or constant maintenance.

Furthermore, by integrating **AI-driven capabilities**—such as route prediction, anomaly detection, and intelligent alerting—the solution can go beyond tracking to deliver operational insights and proactive decision support.

## 👥 Target Users & Use Cases

**Primary Users**:
- **Fleet Managers** — to monitor vehicle movement, prevent misuse, and ensure timely deliveries  
- **Field Operations Teams** — for real-time tracking of mobile tools and service vehicles  
- **Security & Surveillance Units** — to covertly track sensitive or high-risk assets  
- **Construction & Infrastructure Firms** — to oversee heavy equipment usage and prevent unauthorized relocation  
- **Private Individuals** — for personal asset tracking (e.g., bicycles, motorcycles, luggage, boats), anti-theft monitoring, or location-sharing with family

**Secondary Users**:
- **Compliance Officers** — ensuring location-based regulatory adherence (e.g., driver hours, geo-restricted zones)  
- **Dispatch & Routing Coordinators** — to optimize scheduling and rerouting based on live data  
- **AI Analysts** — to extract trends, detect anomalies, or predict maintenance needs from telemetry

## 🧠 Key Features & Functional Scope

- **Real-time GPS telemetry** viewable via web and mobile apps  
- Support for **low-power IoT devices** with smart update intervals to preserve battery life  
- **Geofencing** with adjustable sensitivity and alert thresholds  
- **Historical route playback** for auditing and review  
- **Battery status monitoring** and low-battery alerts  
- **Optional AI-powered insights**, such as:
  - Route optimization suggestions  
  - Anomaly detection (e.g., deviations from expected routes)  
  - Usage pattern analysis  
- **Multi-asset management dashboard** with role-based views (e.g., fleet manager, individual user)  
- **Data security** via encryption, secure device pairing, and explicit user consent flows  
- **Offline support** through on-device buffering during connectivity loss

## 📈 Success Metrics

- **Time-to-fix after geofence alerts** — Measures how quickly users respond to location-based incidents  
- **Number of active tracked assets** — Reflects system adoption and scale across user segments  
- **Retention of private users (30/90 days)** — Indicates sustained consumer value and usability  
- **Fleet operator NPS (Net Promoter Score)** — Gauges enterprise satisfaction and product loyalty  
- **AI feature adoption rate** — Tracks engagement with intelligent features like route prediction or anomaly detection  
- **Battery longevity of devices** — Validates the effectiveness of low-power strategies in the field  
- **Operational savings through predictive insights** — e.g., cost savings from predictive maintenance based on miles driven or anomaly alerts

## 🔍 Known Risks & Open Questions

### 🔧 Technical Risks
- **Battery vs. telemetry tradeoff**: High-frequency updates may reduce battery life significantly, especially in compact or covert devices.  
- **GPS signal reliability**: Indoor or urban-canyon scenarios may lead to degraded accuracy or signal loss.  
- **On-device buffering**: Requires local storage and queue logic, which increases firmware and hardware complexity.

### 🧠 AI Risks
- **False positives from anomaly detection**: Could lead to alert fatigue or unnecessary escalations if thresholds are not well-calibrated.  
- **Black-box AI behavior**: If models are opaque, users may not trust or understand why actions are triggered.

### 🔐 Security & Privacy Risks
- **Misuse of tracking data**: Potential for unauthorized tracking if consent flows are bypassed or compromised.  
- **Regulatory exposure**: GDPR, CCPA, or regional surveillance laws may require strict opt-in policies and audit logging.

### 💬 Open Questions
- What **communication technologies** will the trackers use? (e.g., LTE-M, NB-IoT, LoRaWAN?)  
- Should users be able to **remotely disable** their trackers from the app?  
- Is AI meant to be a **core differentiator** or an **optional add-on**?  
- How will the system **handle disconnected assets** or **delayed uploads**?

## ⚙️ System Constraints

### 🔋 Hardware Constraints
- Devices must operate with **ultra-low power consumption**, targeting **weeks or months** of battery life on a single charge.  
- Trackers must be compact enough for **covert or portable use**, limiting onboard power, memory, and antenna size.  
- Physical button input or screens are intentionally avoided for stealth and durability.

### 🌐 Connectivity Constraints
- Trackers must function in environments with **limited or intermittent cellular coverage** (e.g., rural areas, tunnels).  
- Offline mode must support **data buffering** and **delayed upload** when the connection is restored.

### ⚖️ Regulatory & Legal Constraints
- Must comply with **GDPR** and local regulations for data privacy and location tracking.  
- Requires **explicit opt-in** and **audit logging** for all user or asset-level tracking activities.  
- Personal use cases may require **device-level consent and deactivation** features.

### 🧠 AI & Processing Constraints
- AI inference must be **cloud-based** due to on-device limitations.  
- AI features must include a fallback or **manual override** in the event of false positives.

### 💻 Platform Constraints
- Must support both **mobile-first** and **web-based** control centers.  
- Minimum viable support for Android and modern browsers; iOS preferred but may be phased in.
