# üìã GitHub Issues for GPS Tracking Project

## EPIC 0: GPS Device Sourcing & Design
- [ ] Research commercial GPS tracker vendors (hidden, long-life IoT)
- [ ] Evaluate device protocols (MQTT/HTTP support, encryption)
- [ ] Assess battery performance and form factors
- [ ] Validate compatibility with ingestion backend
- [ ] Build PoC firmware for custom-designed device (optional)
- [ ] Shortlist 2‚Äì3 suppliers or partners for field testing
- [ ] Document provisioning spec: QR code, bootstrap token, cert model
- [ ] Ensure GDPR/CE/FCC compliance for consumer resale

## EPIC 1: Device Telemetry Pipeline
- [ ] Set up MQTT and HTTP ingestion gateways (ASP.NET Core 9)
- [ ] Integrate Kafka/Event Hub for ingestion stream
- [ ] Build telemetry processor service (.NET 9 Worker)
- [ ] Store data in TimescaleDB + PostGIS
- [ ] Real-time cache of ‚Äúlast known location‚Äù in Redis

## EPIC 2: Consent, Identity & Provisioning
