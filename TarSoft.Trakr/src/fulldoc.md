# Super GPS – Product & Architecture Documentation

## 1. Product Requirements Document (PRD)

### Product Summary

**Super GPS** is a full-stack GPS-based fleet tracking solution designed for logistics and operations teams to monitor and manage vehicle fleets in real-time. The system integrates continuous vehicle telemetry with advanced AI models to detect operational inefficiencies, predict maintenance needs, and enhance route optimization.

It features a modern web interface for dashboarding and control, a backend for data ingestion and analytics, and persistent storage for historical data and insights. Core features include live tracking, driver behavior analysis, predictive maintenance, and automated reporting.

Super GPS is built with .NET 8, PostgreSQL, and Clean Architecture principles, and is optimized for performance, maintainability, and seamless scalability.

### Goals and Success Criteria

#### Goals
- Deliver a production-ready, SaaS-based GPS tracking solution for fleet managers  
- Ingest real-time GPS data from pre-installed hardware and store historical movement data  
- Integrate AI models to detect and alert on vehicle maintenance needs before failures occur  
- Provide a web dashboard for live fleet overview, vehicle status, and notifications  
- Ensure multi-tenant scalability and clean separation of tenant data  
- Design with maintainability, observability, and testability in mind (Clean Architecture, .NET 8)  

#### Success Criteria
- MVP deployed to production within 3 months with at least one live tenant  
- Predictive maintenance alerts demonstrate >85% accuracy in initial tests  
- Fleet dashboard supports real-time updates with sub-second latency per vehicle  
- API throughput and UI performance meet p95 response time under 500 ms  
- CI/CD pipeline in place with >90% automated test coverage and structured logging/tracing  
- Positive feedback from first 2 tenant managers on usability and feature coverage  

### Core Functional Requirements

- Users can log in securely and access their organization’s fleet dashboard  
- Real-time GPS data is ingested and displayed on a map for all active vehicles  
- Fleet managers can view current vehicle status, location, speed, and driver identity  
- Predictive maintenance alerts are generated based on historical telemetry data  
- Users can configure thresholds for alerts and receive notifications via email/SMS  
- Historical data is stored and queryable for compliance and analysis  
- Role-based access control distinguishes between Admin, Manager, and Viewer roles  
- Multi-tenant architecture ensures complete isolation of tenant data  
- System provides REST APIs for external reporting or ERP integration  

### Success Metrics

- **System Uptime**: 99.9% availability over a rolling 30-day window  
- **Latency**: ≤ 500 ms p95 for dashboard and APIs under expected load  
- **AI Accuracy**: ≥ 85% accuracy in predicting valid maintenance events  
- **Adoption**: First paying customer within 60 days of MVP release  
- **Engagement**: At least 3 active users per tenant per week by month 2  
- **Retention**: ≥ 75% tenant retention at 6-month mark  
- **Feedback Score**: Average feedback rating ≥ 4.2/5 from first cohort of users  

### Non-Functional Requirements

- **Scalability**: Must support at least 500 concurrent users and 10,000 vehicles across all tenants  
- **Security**: Role-based access control (RBAC), encrypted data at rest and in transit (TLS 1.2+), OWASP compliance  
- **Availability**: 99.9% uptime SLA, regional redundancy for high availability  
- **Performance**: Dashboard and API must maintain p95 latency ≤ 500 ms under normal load  
- **Maintainability**: Modular Clean Architecture, full CI/CD pipeline with automated testing  
- **Observability**: OpenTelemetry support for traces, logs, metrics, and alerts  
- **Data Retention**: Vehicle movement data retained for 6 months by default (configurable)  
- **Compliance**: GDPR-ready, with tenant-level data isolation and user data export support  

### Out of Scope (MVP)

- Mobile app (native or PWA)  
- Route optimization and fuel efficiency suggestions  
- Driver-facing features (mobile access, logs, alerts)  
- Integration with ERP systems or 3rd-party logistics platforms  
- Emissions tracking or carbon offsetting  
- Vehicle health diagnostics beyond GPS/telemetry-based inference  
- Multi-language support  
- Offline mode or data caching for disconnected use

## 2. Architecture Document

### System Overview (Modular Monolith)

**Super GPS** is a SaaS-based fleet tracking platform architected as a **modular monolith** built on .NET 8. It processes GPS telemetry data in real-time and leverages AI to predict vehicle maintenance needs.

The system is composed of:
- A frontend SPA built using [Blazor or React] for fleet monitoring, alerting, and reporting  
- A **.NET 8 modular monolith backend**, following Clean Architecture and separating domain concerns via internal modules (e.g., Telemetry, Vehicles, Alerts, Tenants, AI)  
- A background worker module for AI inference, alert generation, and scheduled tasks  
- A PostgreSQL database for relational storage, with tenant-aware schema design  
- A telemetry ingestion gateway for receiving GPS data (protocol TBD — e.g., HTTP, MQTT)  
- REST APIs exposed for external integrations and system extensibility  
- Observability support via OpenTelemetry for logs, traces, and metrics  

This monolithic codebase maintains a strict boundary between modules using internal APIs and contracts. Deployment is simplified (single process/container) while preserving future scalability by allowing module extraction if needed.
